# Portfolio
This is the repo of my [portfolio webpage](http://studenter.miun.se/~jola1803/dt173g/portfolio/client/) client. Project was made as the end project in course DT173G - Web Development III

### Used Technologies
* HTML5
* SASS
* JavaScript - > ES6(ES2015)
* Gulp

Data is fetched from a REST API that I've build in PHP. Check out repo [here](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Server)

### Usage
* `git clone https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Client.git`
* `npm i`
* `gulp`
  
Note that code is set up to function with this specific [REST API](https://github.com/jona-laa/Portfolio-Server), so you would probably have to clone that one too and adjust it to fit your purpose and also create a database to use with it.
